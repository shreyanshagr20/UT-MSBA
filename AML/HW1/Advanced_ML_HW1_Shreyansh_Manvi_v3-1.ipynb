    "**Problem**: The major roadblock in acceptance of AI/ML based solutions in healthcare industry is that people view themselves and their medical needs as unique. The general perception is that AI does not take into account people's unique characteristics and treat all the individuals same, thereby, providing services that are standardized which makes them more resistant. Hence, as per them AI services are useful only to treat an average patient or medical needs that are standardized, not for services that require personalization. \n",

    "(i) The 3 most important causes of \"data drift\" are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Marriage of big and small data. It is observed that the big data research and more traditional applied statistics live in two different realms and do not work collaboratively. Hence, huge unnecessary correlations caused by big data ultimately leads to overfitting which can be countered by traditional methods. Big data also overlooks the patterns in error or considerable information that could be extracted by traditional statistical methods. Big Data sgould not mean that you can ignore foundational issues of measurement and construct validity and reliability and dependencies among data. Hence, model doesn't perform well on test data\n",
    "\n",
    "* In order to improve its service, the data-generating process/algorithms that are used to extract the search terms or data keeps on changing very frequently. Due to these changes, its tough to keep track of the underlying trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Due to data privacy issues, there is no transparency as the data cannnot be made public. Hence, one can also try replicating the model, again which is not accurate as the supporting papers do not meet all the standards, so correctness of the model can be accurately justified. Moreover, the source of the data cannot be verified as highlighted by Media Stoked Panic which highlights the question if our source is reliable or not. This again can result in data drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) The issue with GFT model was that they were weeding out the seasonal search terms that were unrelated to the flu but strongly correlated to the CDC data. Hence, they were trying to convert the big amount of data into smaller data points. This ultimately led to overfitting of the data as it makes model prone to unnecessary correlations where the big data were overfitting the small number of cases—a standard concern in data analysis.\n",

    "R squared always increases as we add more and more features to the model irrespective of the fact that they might be related to our target variable or not. So in a way, just looking at R Squared value would be fallacious because we might be picking a model with features that have nothing to do with our target variable.\n",

    "Now, the idea behind adjusted R Squared is that it penalizes the R Squared for the number of features. Formula for Adjusted R squared is\n",

    "\n",
    "From the formula, we can see that the value of adjusted R Squared will only increase if the value of R Squared increases considerably upon adding more features. For example, if the R Squared value increases only by a small amount after adding \"k\" new features, the value of 1- Squared won't change much but the denominator would decrease considerably (depending on k) reducing the Adjusted R Squared.\n",

Suppose we have added features to the model that are not related to our target variable, then the model will try to fit the noise associated with those variables as well and hence although the model might have a low error in train data, it will perform poorly when deployed since it's based on the features that are not related to the model.

    "\n",
    "Using the given data and the coefficients plot, its difficult to draw any concrete advantage/ disadvantage of any one of the regularization methods because the best lambda estimates for lasso and ridge are not regularizing the model to a great extent and hence any one model is not showing any significant advantage over other. (Performance of OLS is more or less similar to lasso or ridge)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can draw the general pros/ cons of these three regularization methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge | Pros\n",
    "* It reduces the variance of the model by shrinking the coefficients, but do not equate them to zero. So, in a way, it retains all the parameters\n",
    "* It is particularly useful when the number of coffecients are less and we don't necesarily want to loose the any coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge | Cons\n",
    "* In case of large number of coefficients, it still retains all the coefficients. So the model might have less variance, but it becomes difficult to interpret the model coefficients, especially the ones that have values very close to zero\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso | Pros\n",
    "* It pushes the coefficients to zero (post a value of lambda) and hence, it can act as a feature selection\n",
    "* This becomes particularly useful when there are large number of features and we just want to select a few features\n",
    "* Also, since it pushes coefficients to zero, the result model interpretability also improves\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso | Cons\n",
    "* Sometimes the lasso estimates are known to be unstable i.e if you take a slightly different training set, it might produce very different set of coefficients.\n",
    "* Lasso also struggles with correlated features as it tends to arbitrarily pick the one of the correlated features and pushes the remainder to zero and hence the model interpretability can suffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net | Pros\n",
    "* Its the best of both the worlds, i.e. it combines both l1 and l2 regularization.\n",
    "* Also, you can regulate the weightage of l1 and l2 regularization depending on the need\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net | Cons\n",
    "* Since you have two hyperparameters, you need to tune both of them and it becomes relatively computationally expensive than ridge and lasso.\n",

    "In OLS, if we scale the features, (Beta)iXi remains the same i.e. it's scale invariant. However, in lasso and ridge, we have a penalty term that is directly proportional to sum of betas or beta squared respectively. Due to this, if let's say we multiply a feature by \"s\", then the (Beta) corrosponding to that feature will not necessarily go down by \"s\" to keep (Beta)iXi same. In a way, (Beta)iXi becomes dependent on the scale of features unlike OLS and hence, we should scale the features prior to fitting a Lasso or Ridge model as different scales can result into completely different models.\n",
    "Post standardization, all the features have same variance i.e. 1 and mean=0 and hence the resulting fit won't be dependent on the scale of the features.\n",
